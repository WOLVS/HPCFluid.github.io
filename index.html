  <!-- Introduction to Jekyll Workflow -->
  <section id="jekyll-introduction">
    <h2>Jekyll Workflow Overview</h2>
    <p>
      This open sharing platform is based on Jekyll, which is a static site generator that helps you transform plain text
      into organized, well-structured websites. By working with Markdown and
      template files, Jekyll takes care of the building process, allowing you
      to focus on content rather than managing complex frameworks. Once built,
      your site can be hosted on platforms like GitHub Pages or any other web server.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Structure:</strong> Jekyll organizes your content into
      <code>_posts</code>, <code>_layouts</code>, and <code>_includes</code> directories.</li>
      <li><strong>Templating:</strong> You can use Liquid templates to customize
      how your pages are generated.</li>
      <li><strong>Markdown Support:</strong> Jekyll supports Markdown for writing
      content in a clean, readable format.</li>
      <li><strong>Version Control:</strong> Git can be used to track changes,
      making collaboration simple and efficient.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>About Our AI-Augmented CFD Modeling Initiative</h2>
    <p>
      This project integrates Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques with
      traditional Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulations to achieve
      faster and more accurate flow predictions. By leveraging machine learning
      models trained on a variety of flow conditions, we aim to:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li><strong>Reduce Computation Time:</strong> Machine learning surrogates
      can predict flow fields faster than high-fidelity simulations.</li>
      <li><strong>Improve Accuracy:</strong> AI-augmented models refine
      parameter choices, leading to better mesh adaptation and solver settings.</li>
      <li><strong>Enhance Workflows:</strong> Automating data collection and
      model updates promotes a more robust, scalable CFD process.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      We invite researchers, engineers, and enthusiasts to explore, contribute,
      and refine these methods to push the boundaries of traditional CFD.
